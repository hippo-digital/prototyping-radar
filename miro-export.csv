• Page creation – Views are where you build the actual screens users interact with

• Consistency – All pages automatically share the same layout through inheritance

• Efficiency – Don't repeat header and footer code on every page

• Separation of concerns – Keeping views separate from routes makes code more organised

• Template reuse – Views can extend layouts and include partials

• Maintainability – Change the layout once to update all pages

• Data display – Views receive data from routes and display it dynamically

WCAG basics for prototypers,"Practitioner | Components and Patterns

What is this skill?:

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) basics involves understanding the core principles of accessibility: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. Knowing these helps you build prototypes that represent accessible services.

Why is it important?:

• Design decisions – Understanding WCAG informs better design choices

• Stakeholder conversations – Explain why certain patterns are required

• Compliance awareness – Know what standards the final service must meet

• Testing focus – Know what to check during prototype reviews

What is a macro?,"Working | Components and Patterns

What is this skill?:

A macro is a reusable Nunjucks code block that accepts parameters and outputs HTML. GOV.UK Frontend components are implemented as macros, allowing you to configure them with different options.

Why is it important?:

• Reusability – Write once, use many times with different parameters

• Consistency – Same component looks identical everywhere

• Configuration – Pass different options to customise behaviour

• Foundation – Understanding macros unlocks the full design system

What is Heroku?,"Practitioner | Setup and Deployment

What is this skill?:

Understanding Heroku means knowing it's a cloud platform that hosts your prototype online, making it accessible to stakeholders and research participants without them needing to run the kit locally.

Why is it important?:

• Remote access – Share prototypes with anyone via a URL

• User research – Conduct research sessions with participants anywhere

• Stakeholder reviews – Let product owners and decision makers see progress

• Password protection – Secure your prototype from public access

What is POST and GET?,"Working | Pages and Layouts

What is this skill?:

POST and GET are HTTP methods that determine how data is sent between the browser and server. GET requests fetch pages, while POST requests submit form data. Understanding these is essential for building interactive prototypes.

Why is it important?:

• Form submissions – POST is used when users submit forms with their answers

• Page navigation – GET is used when users click links or type URLs

• Data handling – Knowing which method to use affects how you access user input

• Correct behaviour – Using the right method ensures your prototype works as expected

What is Routing?,"Working | Pages and Layouts

What is this skill?:

Routing is the mechanism that determines which page to show when a user visits a URL or submits a form. In the prototype kit, routes connect URLs to views and control how users navigate through your prototype.

Why is it important?:

• User journeys – Routes define the paths users take through your service

• Form handling – Routes process form submissions and determine what happens next

• Dynamic content – Routes can pass data to pages, enabling personalised experiences

• Branching logic – Routes enable different paths based on user input

What's in the kit,"Working | Setup and Deployment

What is this skill?:

Understanding what's in the kit means knowing the key files, folders, and how the different parts of the GOV.UK or NHS.UK prototype kit work together. This foundational knowledge helps you navigate and modify your prototype effectively.

Why is it important?:

• Faster orientation – Knowing where things are saves time when building or debugging

• Confident modifications – Understanding the structure helps you make changes without breaking things

• Better collaboration – Team members can work together more effectively with shared knowledge

• Foundation for advanced skills – All other prototyping skills build on this understanding
