## What is this skill?

Passing variables to macros involves using session data or other variables to dynamically populate component fields, making forms pre-fill with user data or display personalised content.

## Why is it important?

- **Pre-populated forms** – Show users their previous answers when they return
- **Dynamic content** – Display different text based on user data
- **Check answers pages** – Pass all stored data to summary components
- **Personalisation** – Create tailored experiences for each user
