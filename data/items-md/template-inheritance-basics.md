## What is this skill?

Template inheritance basics involves understanding how Nunjucks 'extends' works to pull in a base layout, giving your pages consistent headers, footers, and structure without duplicating code.

## Why is it important?

- **Consistency** – All pages automatically share the same layout
- **Efficiency** – Don't repeat header and footer code on every page
- **Maintainability** – Change the layout once to update all pages
- **Foundation** – This is how all GOV.UK and NHS prototypes are structured
