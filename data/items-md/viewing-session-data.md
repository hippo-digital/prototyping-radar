## What is this skill?

Viewing session data involves using the prototype admin panel (usually at /manage-prototype/clear-data) to inspect what data is currently stored in the session.

## Why is it important?

- **Debugging** – See exactly what data is stored when things aren't working
- **Understanding flow** – Check how data changes as users move through the journey
- **Testing** – Verify that forms are saving data with the correct names
- **Learning** – Understand how the kit handles data behind the scenes
