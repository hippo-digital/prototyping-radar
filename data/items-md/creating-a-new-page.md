## What is this skill?

Creating a new page involves adding a new .html file to the app/views folder, setting up the basic template structure, and extending the correct layout to ensure consistency with other pages.

## Why is it important?

- **Build your prototype** – You need pages to create any user journey
- **Correct structure** – New pages must extend layouts to work properly
- **Organised files** – Learn to name and place files logically
- **Efficient workflow** – Know when to duplicate existing pages vs. starting fresh
