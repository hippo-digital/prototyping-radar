## What is this skill?

Accordions allow users to show and hide sections of content on a page. Understanding when to use them and how to implement them accessibly is important for organising long pages.

## Why is it important?

- **Content organisation** – Break up long pages into manageable sections
- **Progressive disclosure** – Let users see only what they need
- **Accessibility** – Must be keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly
- **Appropriate use** – Accordions aren't always the right solution
