## What is this skill?

Multi-path journeys involve designing complex user flows where different users take different routes through the service based on their circumstances, eligibility, or choices.

## Why is it important?

- **Realistic services** – Most services have multiple paths for different user types
- **Efficient journeys** – Skip irrelevant questions for each user
- **Edge cases** – Test all possible routes through the service
- **User research** – Understand how different users experience the service
