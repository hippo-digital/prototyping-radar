## What is this skill?

Using external JSON files involves loading data from separate .json files into your prototype, enabling realistic datasets for testing search, lists, and data-driven features.

## Why is it important?

- **Realistic data** – Test with representative datasets
- **Separation of concerns** – Keep data separate from templates
- **Easy updates** – Modify data without changing code
- **Large datasets** – Handle more data than would be practical inline
