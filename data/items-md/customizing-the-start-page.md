## What is this skill?

Customizing the start page involves building a standard GOV.UK or NHS service start page with guidance, eligibility information, and a clear call-to-action button.

## Why is it important?

- **First impression** – The start page sets user expectations for the service
- **Eligibility checking** – Help users understand if the service is right for them
- **Reduce drop-off** – Clear guidance prevents users starting journeys they can't complete
- **Design system compliance** – Follow the standard start page pattern
