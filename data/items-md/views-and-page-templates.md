## What is this skill?

A view is the visual template that renders what users see in the browser. In the prototype kit, views are Nunjucks files in the app/views folder that combine HTML, design system components, and dynamic data. Views use template inheritance ('extends') to share common layouts across pages.

## Why is it important?

- **Page creation** – Views are where you build the actual screens users interact with
- **Consistency** – All pages automatically share the same layout through inheritance
- **Efficiency** – Don't repeat header and footer code on every page
- **Separation of concerns** – Keeping views separate from routes makes code more organised
- **Template reuse** – Views can extend layouts and include partials
- **Maintainability** – Change the layout once to update all pages
- **Data display** – Views receive data from routes and display it dynamically
