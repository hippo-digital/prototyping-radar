## What is this skill?

Cleaning up prototypes involves refactoring code after user research sessions, removing dead ends and unused code, consolidating learnings, and preparing the prototype for the next iteration or handover.

## Why is it important?

- **Maintainable codebase** – Clean prototypes are easier to update and extend
- **Clear documentation** – Helps team members understand what was tested and learned
- **Efficient handover** – Developers can better understand intended interactions
- **Reduced technical debt** – Prevents prototypes from becoming unmaintainable over time
