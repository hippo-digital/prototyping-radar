## What is this skill?

Using the back link correctly involves implementing browser-style back navigation that works reliably, understanding when to use JavaScript history vs explicit URLs.

## Why is it important?

- **User expectation** – Users expect back links to work like the browser back button
- **Journey integrity** – Incorrect back links can break user flows
- **Accessibility** – Back links must be keyboard accessible and properly labelled
- **Design system compliance** – GOV.UK and NHS patterns specify back link behaviour
