## What is this skill?

Linking pages involves creating anchor tags and navigation elements that connect different pages in your prototype. This is fundamental to building any user journey.

## Why is it important?

- **User navigation** – Links are how users move through your service
- **Journey flow** – Connect pages in the correct sequence
- **Accessibility** – Properly formed links work with screen readers and keyboards
- **Foundation skill** – All prototypes require linking pages together
