## What is this skill?

Copying code from the Design System involves finding the right component in the documentation, copying the HTML or Nunjucks example, and adapting it for your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Quick implementation** – Get components working fast
- **Correct structure** – Start with properly formatted code
- **Learn patterns** – Understand how components are built
- **Avoid mistakes** – Copy tested code rather than writing from scratch
