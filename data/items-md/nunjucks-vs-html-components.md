## What is this skill?

Understanding Nunjucks vs HTML components means knowing when to use a Nunjucks macro (for dynamic, configurable components) versus plain HTML (for static, one-off content).

## Why is it important?

- **Right tool for the job** – Choose the appropriate approach for each situation
- **Efficiency** – Macros save time for repeated, dynamic components
- **Simplicity** – HTML is fine for simple, static content
- **Maintenance** – Understanding the difference helps when updating code
