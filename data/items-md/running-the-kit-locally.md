## What is this skill?

Running the kit locally involves using terminal commands to start the GOV.UK or NHS.UK prototype kit on your own machine. This creates a local web server that lets you view and test your prototype in a browser.

## Why is it important?

- **Immediate feedback** – See changes instantly as you develop without waiting for deployments
- **Offline working** – Continue prototyping without an internet connection
- **Safe experimentation** – Test ideas locally before sharing with stakeholders
- **Essential first step** – You cannot build prototypes without being able to run the kit
