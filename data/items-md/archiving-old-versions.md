## What is this skill?

Archiving old versions involves properly storing and documenting past prototype iterations so they can be referenced or restored later. This includes tagging releases, creating branches, and maintaining documentation of what each version contains.

## Why is it important?

- **Audit trail** – Know what was tested in each research round
- **Stakeholder requests** – Quickly retrieve specific past versions
- **Learning from history** – Review how designs evolved over time
- **Compliance** – Some projects require version history for governance
