## What is this skill?

The assets folder is where you store images, custom JavaScript files, and stylesheets for your prototype. Understanding how to organise and reference these files correctly ensures your prototype looks and functions as intended.

## Why is it important?

- **Visual fidelity** – Add images, icons, and logos to make prototypes more realistic
- **Custom styling** – Include your own CSS to extend or override default styles
- **Interactive elements** – Add JavaScript for enhanced user interactions
- **Organised codebase** – Proper asset management keeps your prototype maintainable
