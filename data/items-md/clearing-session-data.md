## What is this skill?

Clearing session data involves resetting the prototype to a clean state, removing all stored user input so you can start a fresh journey without previous answers affecting the experience.

## Why is it important?

- **Clean testing** – Start each research session with no pre-existing data
- **Multiple scenarios** – Test different journeys without interference from old data
- **Debugging** – Rule out stale data as a cause of unexpected behaviour
- **User research** – Ensure each participant starts with a blank slate
