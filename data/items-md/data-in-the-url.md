## What is this skill?

Data in the URL involves understanding how query strings (like ?name=value) can pass information between pages, and how to read these parameters in your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Deep linking** – Link directly to specific states or scenarios
- **External integration** – Receive data from other systems via URLs
- **Testing shortcuts** – Jump to specific journey points with pre-set data
- **Sharing states** – Send links that reproduce specific prototype states
