## What is this skill?

User research handoff involves preparing your prototype for user research sessions. This includes creating clear starting points, resetting data between sessions, and documenting which journeys to test.

## Why is it important?

- **Consistent testing** – Every participant starts from the same point
- **Researcher independence** – Researchers can run sessions without developer support
- **Clear scenarios** – Document which paths to test and what data to use
- **Clean data** – Reset session data between participants
