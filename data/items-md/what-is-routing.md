## What is this skill?

Routing is the mechanism that determines which page to show when a user visits a URL or submits a form. In the prototype kit, routes connect URLs to views and control how users navigate through your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **User journeys** – Routes define the paths users take through your service
- **Form handling** – Routes process form submissions and determine what happens next
- **Dynamic content** – Routes can pass data to pages, enabling personalised experiences
- **Branching logic** – Routes enable different paths based on user input
