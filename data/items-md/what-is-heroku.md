## What is this skill?

Understanding Heroku means knowing it's a cloud platform that hosts your prototype online, making it accessible to stakeholders and research participants without them needing to run the kit locally.

## Why is it important?

- **Remote access** – Share prototypes with anyone via a URL
- **User research** – Conduct research sessions with participants anywhere
- **Stakeholder reviews** – Let product owners and decision makers see progress
- **Password protection** – Secure your prototype from public access
