## What is this skill?

Deploying to Heroku involves pushing your prototype code to Heroku's servers so it's accessible online. This includes setting up the app, configuring environment variables, and managing deployments.

## Why is it important?

- **Share your work** – Make prototypes accessible to stakeholders and users
- **Remote research** – Conduct user research sessions with participants anywhere
- **Continuous updates** – Push changes and see them live within minutes
- **Professional workflow** – Deployment skills are valuable across all development work
