## What is this skill?

Storing data in session involves understanding how the prototype kit remembers user input across pages using the session object. Form data is automatically stored and persists throughout the journey.

## Why is it important?

- **Data persistence** – User answers are remembered across multiple pages
- **Dynamic content** – Display previous answers in later pages
- **Branching logic** – Use stored data to determine which path users take
- **Check answers pages** – Show users a summary of all their responses
