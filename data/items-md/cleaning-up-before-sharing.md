## What is this skill?

Cleaning up before sharing involves removing unused files, test data, console logs, and commented-out code before sharing your prototype with stakeholders or deploying it for user research.

## Why is it important?

- **Professionalism** – Clean prototypes reflect well on your team
- **Reduced confusion** – Remove dead ends and incomplete journeys
- **Performance** – Smaller prototypes load faster
- **Security** – Remove any test credentials or sensitive data
