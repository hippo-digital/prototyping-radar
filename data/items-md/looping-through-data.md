## What is this skill?

Looping through data involves using Nunjucks 'for' loops to iterate over arrays and objects, displaying lists of items dynamically from data.

## Why is it important?

- **Dynamic lists** – Generate lists from data rather than hard-coding
- **Repeated patterns** – Render the same component multiple times with different data
- **Task lists** – Display lists of tasks or items from session data
- **Summary tables** – Build tables from arrays of user responses
