## What is this skill?

Password protection involves adding simple authentication to your deployed prototype to prevent public access. This is essential when your prototype contains sensitive design work or is hosted publicly.

## Why is it important?

- **Confidentiality** – Protect unreleased designs from public view
- **Controlled access** – Only share with intended testers and stakeholders
- **Heroku requirement** – Many teams require password protection before deployment
- **Research integrity** – Prevent participants from accessing the prototype early
