## What is this skill?

Git basics involves using version control to track changes to your prototype, create commits, and push your code to remote repositories like GitHub. This protects your work and enables collaboration.

## Why is it important?

- **Never lose work** – Git tracks every change, so you can always recover previous versions
- **Collaboration** – Share your prototype with team members and work together
- **Deployment** – Most hosting platforms (like Heroku) use Git for deployment
- **Professional practice** – Version control is standard in all software development
