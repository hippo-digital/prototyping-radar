## What is this skill?

Simulating errors involves creating error states, validation messages, and error summary pages in your prototype. This helps test how users respond to problems and ensures your service handles errors gracefully.

## Why is it important?

- **Realistic testing** – Users will encounter errors; test their reactions in research
- **Accessible error handling** – Practice implementing error summaries and inline messages correctly
- **Design system compliance** – Learn to use GOV.UK or NHS error patterns properly
- **Complete journeys** – Error states are a crucial part of any user journey
