## What is this skill?

Deep linking involves creating URLs that link directly to specific states or pages within your prototype, including form data or session state. This allows testers to jump directly to a specific point in a journey.

## Why is it important?

- **User research efficiency** – Jump directly to the screen you want to test
- **Bug reporting** – Share exact URLs that reproduce issues
- **Stakeholder reviews** – Send links to specific pages for feedback
- **Testing edge cases** – Create URLs that set up specific scenarios
