## What is this skill?

Debugging involves systematically finding and fixing problems in your prototype. This includes using browser developer tools, reading terminal error messages, and using console.log to inspect data.

## Why is it important?

- **Self-sufficiency** – Fix your own problems without waiting for help
- **Faster iteration** – Quickly identify and resolve issues during development
- **Learn how things work** – Debugging teaches you how the kit functions internally
- **Better code quality** – Understanding errors helps you write more robust prototypes
