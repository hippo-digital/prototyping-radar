## What is this skill?

Advanced Git involves using branches to work on features separately, merging changes, resolving conflicts, and using Git history to understand or revert changes in your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Safe experimentation** – Test ideas in branches without affecting the main prototype
- **Team collaboration** – Multiple people can work on different features simultaneously
- **Version management** – Maintain different versions for different research rounds
- **Recovery** – Revert problematic changes without losing other work
