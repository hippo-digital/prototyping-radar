## What is this skill?

Installing the kit involves downloading the prototype kit, setting up Node.js, and running npm install to get all dependencies. This is the first step before you can start building prototypes.

## Why is it important?

- **Get started** – You cannot prototype without first installing the kit
- **Understand dependencies** – Learn how Node.js and NPM work together
- **Troubleshoot setup issues** – Know how to fix common installation problems
- **Set up new projects** – Create fresh prototypes whenever needed
