## What is this skill?

Passing data between pages involves ensuring variables persist across the journey by using session storage, hidden fields, or URL parameters appropriately.

## Why is it important?

- **Journey continuity** – Keep track of user input across multiple pages
- **Form pre-population** – Show previous answers when users go back
- **Check answers** – Collect all data for summary pages
- **Conditional journeys** – Use earlier answers to influence later pages
