## What is this skill?

Using the /index page involves organizing your prototype's landing page to provide clear navigation to different journeys, versions, or test scenarios within your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Organization** – Provides a central hub for all your prototype journeys
- **User research** – Facilitators can quickly navigate to the right starting point
- **Version management** – Link to different iterations or scenarios
- **Documentation** – Add notes about what each journey tests
