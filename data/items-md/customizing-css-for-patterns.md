## What is this skill?

Customizing CSS for patterns involves writing custom Sass or CSS to modify the appearance of standard components or create new visual styles for your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Visual testing** – Test design variations with stakeholders
- **Brand requirements** – Adapt patterns for specific service needs
- **Gap filling** – Style elements not covered by the design system
- **Iteration** – Quickly try different visual approaches
