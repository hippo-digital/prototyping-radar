## What is this skill?

Node.js basics involves understanding that Node.js is the JavaScript runtime that powers the prototype kit. It runs the server that serves your prototype pages and processes your routes.

## Why is it important?

- **Understand the foundation** – Node.js is what makes the prototype kit work
- **Install the right version** – Different kit versions may require specific Node.js versions
- **Debug server errors** – Recognise when issues are Node.js related
- **Extend functionality** – Node.js knowledge enables more advanced prototyping
