## What is this skill?

Storing user answers involves understanding how form data flows through your prototype. The 'name' attribute on form fields determines the key used in session storage, and this data persists across pages throughout the user's journey.

## Why is it important?

- **Data flow** – The name attribute determines how data is stored and retrieved
- **Data persistence** – User answers are remembered across multiple pages
- **Form pre-filling** – Correct names allow the kit to auto-fill forms with previous answers
- **Dynamic content** – Display previous answers in later pages
- **Branching logic** – Use stored data to determine which path users take
- **Check answers pages** – Show users a summary of all their responses
- **Debugging** – Mismatched names are a common source of bugs
