## What is this skill?

Dynamic routing logic involves advanced server-side routing that changes the user's path based on complex combinations of session data, external factors, or calculated states.

## Why is it important?

- **Complex services** – Handle sophisticated eligibility and routing requirements
- **Personalisation** – Tailor journeys based on user characteristics
- **Integration simulation** – Mimic real backend logic and API responses
- **Edge case handling** – Manage unusual scenarios gracefully
