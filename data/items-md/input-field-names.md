## What is this skill?

Input field names are the 'name' attributes on form fields that determine how data is stored in the session. Getting these right is essential for data to flow correctly through your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Data storage** – The name attribute determines the key used in session data
- **Data retrieval** – You need the exact name to display stored values later
- **Form pre-filling** – Correct names allow the kit to auto-fill forms with previous answers
- **Debugging** – Mismatched names are a common source of bugs
