## What is this skill?

## Why is it important?

- **Customisation** – Adapt components to your specific needs
- **Correct labelling** – Ensure form fields have proper labels for accessibility
- **Unique IDs** – Prevent conflicts when using multiple instances
- **Foundation** – Basic options are the first step to mastering macros
