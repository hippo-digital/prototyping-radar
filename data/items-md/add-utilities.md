## What is this skill?

Adding utilities involves using helper classes and functions to extend your prototype's functionality. This includes GOV.UK Frontend utility classes for spacing, typography, and layout, as well as creating your own helper functions.

## Why is it important?

- **Rapid styling** – Apply consistent spacing and typography without writing custom CSS
- **Design system compliance** – Utility classes ensure you follow GOV.UK or NHS design standards
- **Cleaner code** – Reusable utilities reduce duplication across your prototype
- **Faster prototyping** – Spend less time on repetitive styling tasks
