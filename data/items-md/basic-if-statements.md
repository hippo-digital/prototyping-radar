## What is this skill?

Basic 'if' statements in Nunjucks allow you to show or hide content based on conditions, such as whether a user has entered certain data or selected a specific option.

## Why is it important?

- **Dynamic content** – Show different content based on user input
- **Conditional visibility** – Hide sections that aren't relevant to the user
- **Error handling** – Display error messages only when validation fails
- **Personalisation** – Tailor the experience based on previous answers
