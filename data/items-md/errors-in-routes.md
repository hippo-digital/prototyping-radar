## What is this skill?

Debugging errors in routes involves understanding how the routes.js file works and troubleshooting issues that prevent your prototype from handling form submissions, redirects, and page navigation correctly.

## Why is it important?

- **Unblock development** – Route errors stop your prototype from working entirely
- **Understand data flow** – Debugging routes teaches you how data moves through your prototype
- **Build confidence** – Once you can fix route errors, you can tackle more complex logic
- **Better error messages** – Learn to read Node.js error messages to quickly identify problems
