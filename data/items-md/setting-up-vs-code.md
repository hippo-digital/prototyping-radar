## Why is it important?

- **Productivity** – A well-configured editor speeds up your development workflow
- **Error prevention** – Syntax highlighting helps you spot mistakes early
- **Consistency** – Formatters ensure your code follows a consistent style
- **Integrated workflow** – Run terminal commands and edit files in one place
