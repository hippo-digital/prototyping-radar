## What is this skill?

Managing versions involves keeping track of different prototype kit versions, updating dependencies safely, and understanding how to roll back if an update causes problems.

## Why is it important?

- **Stability** – Keep your prototype working reliably across updates
- **Team consistency** – Ensure everyone is using the same version
- **Safe updates** – Know how to update without breaking your prototype
- **Access new features** – Upgrade to get the latest components and fixes
