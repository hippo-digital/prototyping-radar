## What is this skill?

Isolating patterns for reuse involves extracting components from your prototype into standalone, well-documented modules that can be shared across projects or with other teams.

## Why is it important?

- **Cross-project efficiency** – Reuse proven patterns in future prototypes
- **Team collaboration** – Share components with colleagues
- **Design system contribution** – Prepare patterns for wider adoption
- **Quality improvement** – Isolated patterns get more attention and refinement
