## What is this skill?

Basic page layouts involves using the GOV.UK grid system with rows and columns to structure content on your pages, ensuring consistent spacing and responsive behaviour.

## Why is it important?

- **Responsive design** – Layouts adapt to different screen sizes
- **Consistency** – Match the standard GOV.UK page structure
- **Content hierarchy** – Organise information logically
- **Two-thirds pattern** – Use the standard content width for readability
