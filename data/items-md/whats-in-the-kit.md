## What is this skill?

Understanding what's in the kit means knowing the key files, folders, and how the different parts of the GOV.UK or NHS.UK prototype kit work together. This foundational knowledge helps you navigate and modify your prototype effectively.

## Why is it important?

- **Faster orientation** – Knowing where things are saves time when building or debugging
- **Confident modifications** – Understanding the structure helps you make changes without breaking things
- **Better collaboration** – Team members can work together more effectively with shared knowledge
- **Foundation for advanced skills** – All other prototyping skills build on this understanding
