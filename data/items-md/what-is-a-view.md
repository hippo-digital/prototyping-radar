## What is this skill?

A view is the visual template that renders what users see in the browser. In the prototype kit, views are Nunjucks files in the app/views folder that combine HTML, design system components, and dynamic data.

## Why is it important?

- **Page creation** – Views are where you build the actual screens users interact with
- **Separation of concerns** – Keeping views separate from routes makes code more organised
- **Template reuse** – Views can extend layouts and include partials for consistency
- **Data display** – Views receive data from routes and display it dynamically
