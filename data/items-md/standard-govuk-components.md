## What is this skill?

Standard GOV.UK components are pre-built, accessible UI elements like buttons, radios, checkboxes, and text inputs that form the foundation of any government service prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Accessibility built-in** – Components have been thoroughly tested for accessibility
- **Consistency** – Match the look and feel of live government services
- **Speed** – No need to build common elements from scratch
- **Best practices** – Components embody research-backed design decisions
