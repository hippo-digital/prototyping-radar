## What is this skill?

POST and GET are HTTP methods that determine how data is sent between the browser and server. GET requests fetch pages, while POST requests submit form data. Understanding these is essential for building interactive prototypes.

## Why is it important?

- **Form submissions** – POST is used when users submit forms with their answers
- **Page navigation** – GET is used when users click links or type URLs
- **Data handling** – Knowing which method to use affects how you access user input
- **Correct behaviour** – Using the right method ensures your prototype works as expected
