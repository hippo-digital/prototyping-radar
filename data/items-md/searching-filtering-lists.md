## What is this skill?

Searching and filtering lists involves implementing search functionality that filters displayed results based on user input, enabling address lookups, reference searches, and dynamic lists.

## Why is it important?

- **Search testing** – Test how users interact with search interfaces
- **Address lookup** – Simulate postcode or address finder patterns
- **Reference finding** – Look up records by reference number
- **Dynamic results** – Show filtered lists that update based on criteria
