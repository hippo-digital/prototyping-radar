## What is this skill?

Custom Nunjucks filters are JavaScript functions you write to transform data in templates, extending the built-in filters with your own formatting logic.

## Why is it important?

- **Custom formatting** – Format dates, currencies, or text your way
- **Reusable logic** – Write once, use across all templates
- **Clean templates** – Keep complex transformations out of views
- **Consistent output** – Ensure data is always formatted the same way
