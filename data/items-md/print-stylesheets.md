## What is this skill?

Print stylesheets involve creating CSS rules that apply when a user prints a page or saves it as PDF. This ensures important content is visible and unnecessary elements like navigation are hidden in the printed version.

## Why is it important?

- **Accessibility** – Users may need to print forms or reference materials
- **Official documents** – Some services require printable summaries or receipts
- **User testing** – Test if printed versions of pages meet user needs
- **Professional output** – Ensure printed pages look intentional, not broken
