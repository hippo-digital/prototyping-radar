## What is this skill?

Prototype documentation involves writing clear README files and inline comments that explain how to run your prototype, what scenarios are available, and any special setup required.

## Why is it important?

- **Team handover** – Others can pick up your prototype without explanation
- **Future you** – Remember how things work when you return to a project
- **Research preparation** – Document scenarios for user researchers
- **Stakeholder sharing** – Include instructions for non-technical reviewers
