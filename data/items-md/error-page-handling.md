## What is this skill?

Error page handling involves creating custom 404 (not found) and 500 (server error) pages for your prototype. This helps test how users respond to errors and ensures a consistent experience when things go wrong.

## Why is it important?

- **User experience** – Guide users back to safety when they hit an error
- **Realistic testing** – Test error scenarios during user research
- **Consistent branding** – Error pages should match your service design
- **Debugging** – Custom error pages can show helpful developer information
