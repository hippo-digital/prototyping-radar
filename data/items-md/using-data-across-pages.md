## What is this skill?

Using data across pages involves passing variables between pages using session storage, hidden fields, or URL parameters, and then rendering dynamic content based on that stored data.

## Why is it important?

- **Journey continuity** – Keep track of user input across multiple pages
- **Form pre-population** – Show previous answers when users go back
- **Personalisation** – Address users by name or reference their choices
- **Contextual content** – Show relevant information based on earlier answers
- **Check answers pages** – Display summaries of user input
- **Confirmation details** – Show submitted information on confirmation pages
- **Conditional journeys** – Use earlier answers to influence later pages
