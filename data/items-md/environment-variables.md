## What is this skill?

Environment variables allow you to configure your prototype differently for local development versus deployment. They're used to store settings like feature flags, API keys, or environment-specific URLs without hardcoding them.

## Why is it important?

- **Security** – Keep sensitive data out of your codebase
- **Flexibility** – Change behaviour without modifying code
- **Deployment ready** – Configure differently for Heroku vs local
- **Feature toggles** – Enable or disable features per environment
