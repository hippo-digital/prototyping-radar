## What is this skill?

A macro is a reusable Nunjucks code block that accepts parameters and outputs HTML. GOV.UK Frontend components are implemented as macros, allowing you to configure them with different options.

## Why is it important?

- **Reusability** – Write once, use many times with different parameters
- **Consistency** – Same component looks identical everywhere
- **Configuration** – Pass different options to customise behaviour
- **Foundation** – Understanding macros unlocks the full design system
