## What is this skill?

Complex data structures involves working with nested objects, arrays of objects, and multi-level data hierarchies that represent real-world service data.

## Why is it important?

- **Real-world simulation** – Match how production systems structure data
- **Multi-item forms** – Handle "add another" patterns with arrays
- **Relationship mapping** – Connect related pieces of information
- **Advanced prototypes** – Build sophisticated data-driven features
