## What is this skill?

Redirecting with logic involves using routes to send users to different pages based on their form answers, enabling branching journeys and eligibility checks.

## Why is it important?

- **Branching journeys** – Send users down different paths based on answers
- **Eligibility screening** – Redirect ineligible users to appropriate pages
- **Skip logic** – Jump over irrelevant questions
- **Dynamic experiences** – Create personalised journeys
