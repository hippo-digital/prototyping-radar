## What is this skill?

Generating reference numbers involves creating unique identifiers for submissions or applications in your prototype. These help make confirmation pages feel realistic and can be used to track test scenarios.

## Why is it important?

- **Realistic prototypes** – Users expect a reference number after submitting
- **User research** – Test if users understand what to do with reference numbers
- **Scenario tracking** – Identify different test sessions or submissions
- **Confidence building** – Reference numbers reassure users their submission was received
