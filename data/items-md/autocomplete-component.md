## What is this skill?

The autocomplete component (also called typeahead or accessible autocomplete) helps users select from a long list of options by filtering as they type. Essential for country selectors, address lookups, or any large list.

## Why is it important?

- **User experience** – Faster than scrolling through hundreds of options
- **Accessibility** – The GOV.UK component is built to be screen reader friendly
- **Error reduction** – Helps users find and select the correct option
- **Mobile friendly** – Works better than long dropdowns on small screens
