## What is this skill?

Adding delays involves simulating system processing time in your prototype, such as loading spinners or "please wait" pages. This helps test user expectations and design appropriate feedback for slow operations.

## Why is it important?

- **Realistic expectations** – Real services have processing time; test user patience
- **Loading states** – Design appropriate feedback for operations that take time
- **User research insights** – Understand how users react to waiting
- **Anxiety reduction** – Test whether your loading patterns reassure users
