## What is this skill?

Previewing in localhost involves navigating to your local server address (usually localhost:3000) in a browser to view and test your prototype as you develop it.

## Why is it important?

- **Immediate feedback** – See your changes as you make them
- **Testing** – Check that links, forms, and logic work correctly
- **Debugging** – Identify visual and functional issues early
- **Development workflow** – Essential for iterative prototyping
