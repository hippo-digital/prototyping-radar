## What is this skill?

Building complex macros involves creating sophisticated Nunjucks components with nested logic, multiple parameters, default values, and conditional rendering based on the options passed in.

## Why is it important?

- **Flexibility** – Create components that adapt to many different use cases
- **Production-like quality** – Build macros that match GOV.UK Frontend standards
- **Reduced duplication** – Handle variations within a single macro
- **Team efficiency** – Provide powerful tools for less experienced team members
