## What is this skill?

Sass compile errors occur when the kit's stylesheet preprocessor encounters syntax issues or invalid code. Understanding how to read and fix these errors is essential for customising the appearance of your prototype.

## Why is it important?

- **Keeps your prototype running** – Sass errors will prevent the kit from compiling, blocking all development work
- **Enables visual customisation** – Once you can debug Sass, you can confidently add custom styles
- **Speeds up troubleshooting** – Recognising common error patterns helps you fix issues quickly
- **Builds foundational CSS knowledge** – Understanding Sass errors improves your overall front-end skills
