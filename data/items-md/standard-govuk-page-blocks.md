## What is this skill?

Understanding standard GOV.UK page blocks means knowing about the 'content', 'beforeContent', and other named blocks in the page template that you can override to place content in specific areas.

## Why is it important?

- **Correct placement** – Put back links, breadcrumbs, and main content in the right places
- **Design system compliance** – Follow the expected page structure
- **Flexibility** – Override only the blocks you need to change
- **Consistency** – Ensures your pages match GOV.UK or NHS patterns
