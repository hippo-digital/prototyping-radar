## What is this skill?

NPM (Node Package Manager) packages are reusable code libraries that extend the functionality of your prototype. Understanding how to install, update, and manage these dependencies is crucial for maintaining your prototype kit.

## Why is it important?

- **Access to powerful tools** – NPM packages provide ready-made solutions for common problems
- **Keep your kit updated** – Understanding NPM helps you update the GOV.UK Frontend and other dependencies
- **Troubleshoot installation issues** – Many kit problems stem from NPM-related issues
- **Extend functionality** – Add new features to your prototype using community packages
