# 📋 Quick Miro Import - Simple Files

I've created simplified files with just titles and categories (no descriptions).

## ✅ Files Ready to Use:

### 1. **miro-copy-paste.txt** (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED!)
- **Best for**: Quick copy-paste into Miro
- **How to use**:
  1. Open the file (already opened for you!)
  2. Select a section (e.g., "Working" skills under one quadrant)
  3. Copy the skill names
  4. In Miro, paste them - each line becomes a sticky note!
  5. Repeat for each section

**Example**: Copy these 3 lines from the file:
```
Setting up VS Code
Installing the kit
Node.js basics
```
Paste in Miro → Creates 3 sticky notes automatically!

### 2. **miro-simple.csv**
- **Best for**: CSV import in Miro
- **Columns**: Title, Quadrant, Ring
- **How to use**:
  1. In Miro: "..." menu → "Import from CSV"
  2. Upload `miro-simple.csv`
  3. Map columns
  4. Done!

### 3. **miro-simple.tsv**
- **Best for**: Spreadsheet apps or direct paste
- **Format**: Tab-separated (opens in Excel/Google Sheets)
- Can copy from spreadsheet and paste into Miro

## 🎨 Quick Layout Guide

Organize into 4 sections:

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ Setup & Deployment  │ Components &        │
│ (30 skills)         │ Patterns (24)       │
│                     │                     │
│ 🟡 Working (14)     │ 🟡 Working (10)     │
│ 🟢 Practitioner(13) │ 🟢 Practitioner (9) │
│ 🔵 Expert (3)       │ 🔵 Expert (5)       │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Pages & Layouts     │ Data & Logic        │
│ (29 skills)         │ (25 skills)         │
│                     │                     │
│ 🟡 Working (14)     │ 🟡 Working (8)      │
│ 🟢 Practitioner(11) │ 🟢 Practitioner (7) │
│ 🔵 Expert (4)       │ 🔵 Expert (10)      │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Fastest Method:

1. Open `miro-copy-paste.txt` (already open!)
2. Copy the "Working" skills from "Setup and Deployment" (14 lines)
3. In Miro, paste them in the top-left section
4. Color them yellow (Working level)
5. Repeat for each ring level and quadrant

**Total time: ~5-10 minutes to paste all 108 skills!**

## 💡 Pro Tips:

- **Bulk paste**: Select multiple lines at once
- **Color as you go**: Paste all "Working" skills, then color them yellow together
- **Use frames**: Create a frame for each quadrant to keep organized
- **Tag in Miro**: Add tags like "working", "practitioner", "expert" for easy filtering

**Ready to go!** Start with `miro-copy-paste.txt` - it's the fastest way! 🎯
